Test repo to demonstrate a simple bug with ActiveModel::Serializer and SimpleDelegator

Interesting bits:
  - This is built with the latest version of ActiveModel::Serializer installed via Bundler, 0.9.3
  - [The test: test/models/post\_test.rb](https://github.com/xionon/active-model-serializer-with-delegators/blob/master/test/models/post_test.rb)
  - [The delegator: app/models/post\_with\_double\_title.rb](https://github.com/xionon/active-model-serializer-with-delegators/blob/master/app/models/post_with_double_title.rb)
